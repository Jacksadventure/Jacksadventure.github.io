Hi, I’m Zijian (Jack) Luo, a Master of Philosophy(Mphil.) student in Computer Science at the University of Sydney, supervised by Dr. Rahul Gopinath and Dr. Xi Wu. I am also a Research Assistant at Oracle Labs, where I focus on applying Large Language Models to real-world software engineering challenges, including automated program repair, fuzzing, and symbolic execution. My work has led to publications at top-tier venues such as ISSRE 2025 (Core A) and ICSME 2025 (Core A), and I actively maintain open-source projects like Grammar_bench and Readme2artifacts.
