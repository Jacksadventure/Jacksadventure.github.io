<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Agent-based approaches appear to be a natural and straightforward way to tackle software development tasks. After all, human developers also perform similar actions and use feedback to plan future steps. However, the disparity between human and current LLM abilities leads to the following limitations of agent-based approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complex tool usage/design.</li>
<li>Lack of control in decision planning.</li>
<li>Limited ability to self-reflect. </li>
</ul>
<p>In this work authors made the following contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>An AGENTLESS approach</li>
<li>Extensive evaluation</li>
<li>SWE-bench Lite-S benchmark. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="AGENTLESS-Approch"><a href="#AGENTLESS-Approch" class="headerlink" title="AGENTLESS Approch"></a>AGENTLESS Approch</h2><p>Like other automated program repair, there are three steps in the repairing process: 1. Localization 2. Repair 3.Validation</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Localization"><a href="#Step-1-Localization" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Localization"></a>Step 1: Localization</h3><p>Localization is top-down process, form repository level(files level) to element(classes/functions/variables) level, finally lines level.</p>
<h4 id="Localize-to-suspicious-files"><a href="#Localize-to-suspicious-files" class="headerlink" title="Localize to suspicious files"></a>Localize to suspicious files</h4><p>AGENTLESS starts by creating a tree-like representation of the repository’s structure, similar to the Linux tree command, which maintains the organizational hierarchy of files and directories. The system then employs two parallel strategies to locate suspicious files: a prompting-based approach where an LLM analyzes the repository structure alongside the issue description to identify suspicious files, and an embedding-based retrieval method that first filters out irrelevant folders through LLM analysis, then computes similarities between code segments and the issue description using embeddings. Finally, AGENTLESS synthesizes the results from both approaches by selecting the most commonly identified files, producing a focused list of relevant files that likely need inspection or modification to resolve the issue.</p>
<h3 id="Localize-to-suspicious-elements"><a href="#Localize-to-suspicious-elements" class="headerlink" title="Localize to suspicious elements"></a>Localize to suspicious elements</h3><p>AGENTLESS employs a “skeleton format” as the second phase of its localization process, which creates a compressed representation of suspicious files to efficiently analyze their structure. Instead of processing entire files, which can be impractical for large codebases, it extracts only essential elements including class declarations with their fields and method signatures, function headers, class and module-level comments, and variable declarations. As demonstrated in the example figure with UUIDField and JSONField classes, this streamlined format is fed to an LLM in a single prompt, enabling comprehensive analysis of all suspicious files simultaneously while significantly reducing processing overhead. This approach strikes a crucial balance between preserving necessary code context and achieving efficient processing by excluding implementation details, ultimately allowing the LLM to identify the most relevant elements that need examination for issue resolution.</p>
<h3 id="Localize-to-the-edit-locations"><a href="#Localize-to-the-edit-locations" class="headerlink" title="Localize to the edit locations"></a>Localize to the edit locations</h3><p>Directly provide the code content from these elements to the LLM and ask it to localize specific edit locations.</p>
<h3 id="Step-2-Repair"><a href="#Step-2-Repair" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Repair"></a>Step 2: Repair</h3><p>The repair stage aims to generate a correct patch for an identified issue using an LLM. It first constructs a context window around the faulty code (e.g., expanding lines 40–78 to include surrounding lines) to provide relevant context. If multiple locations are involved, they are concatenated with “…” to indicate omitted sections. Instead of rewriting entire code blocks, the LLM generates patches in a Search/Replace format,<img src="/images/search_replace.png" alt="search_replace"> where it specifies the original snippet to be replaced and the corresponding fix. This approach is more efficient, accurate, and reliable, reducing the risk of hallucination. To improve results, AGENTLESS first applies a greedy patch generation strategy, then samples multiple alternative patches with a higher temperature setting for diversity.</p>
<h3 id="Step-3-Validation"><a href="#Step-3-Validation" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Validation"></a>Step 3: Validation</h3><p>AGENTLESS validates patches through reproduction test generation and patch selection to ensure correctness. Since newly raised issues often lack bug-triggering tests, AGENTLESS synthesizes reproduction tests using an LLM, generating multiple candidates to reproduce the issue (Issue reproduced) and verify its resolution (Issue resolved). The most frequently occurring valid test is selected after normalization. For patch selection, AGENTLESS first runs all existing tests to identify regression tests but excludes those that may need modifications for issue resolution. It then executes the regression tests on all candidate patches, keeping those with the fewest failures and requiring them to pass the reproduction test. If no patch passes the reproduction test, selection relies only on regression results. Finally, AGENTLESS applies majority voting, normalizing patches and selecting the most common one. This efficient, agent-free, three-phase approach ensures accurate patch selection while minimizing unnecessary complexity.</p>
<h2 id="Evaluation"><a href="#Evaluation" class="headerlink" title="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</h2><p>In the SWE_bench Lite dataset, AGENTLESS with GPT_4o achieved 32% of resolved rate in total test cases with $0.7 average cost, it also achieved 35.3%, 52.0% and 69.7% respectively in Line, Function, file level of localization, which is the state-of-art model among open-source approaches.</p>
<h2 id="Threats-to-Validity"><a href="#Threats-to-Validity" class="headerlink" title="Threats to Validity"></a>Threats to Validity</h2><p>AGENTLESS faces internal and external threats to validity. Internally, a key concern is potential data leakage from ground truth developer patches in SWE-bench Lite being included in GPT-4o’s training data. Since GPT-4o is closed-source, verifying this is impossible. However, prior research has relied on similar closed-source models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude-3.5), and AGENTLESS still outperforms existing open-source solutions using the same models. Additionally, SWE-bench authors found no significant difference in resolution rates before and after GPT-4’s knowledge cutoff, making full mitigation infeasible without retraining GPT-4o from scratch. Externally, AGENTLESS’s generalizability is uncertain as it has primarily been tested on SWE-bench Lite, though this is the most widely used dataset with diverse problems. OpenAI independently validated AGENTLESS on SWE-bench Lite, SWE-bench, and SWE-bench Verified, confirming its superiority over open-source alternatives. Furthermore, OpenAI’s Sept. 12, 2024, release of the o1 model family featured AGENTLESS as the leading approach on SWE-bench. Future work aims to further address external validity by evaluating AGENTLESS on additional benchmarks.</p>
